# Enhancing Art Classification: A Comparative Study of CNN, Transfer Learning, and SVM Models

## Basic Overview

This project aims to enhance the classification of art images through a comparative study of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), Transfer Learning, and Support Vector Machine (SVM) models. By leveraging the power of deep learning and machine learning techniques, the project provides insights into the effectiveness of different models in classifying various art styles and genres.
